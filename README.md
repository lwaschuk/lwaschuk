### Some of the projects I've completed...
- [BetterGrades](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/bettergrades/id6448234941) - BetterGrades is an grade tracking app I created at the tail end of university due to the annoyance of always entering my grades on websites to see my currect standing. The app persists your grades so you always know how your doing throughout terms. Available on iPhone, iPad, macOS!!!
- [BetterBlitz](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/betterblitz/id6738761472?uo=2) - Dutch Blitz is a popular activity in the office and I was tired of doing the end of round math's to update everyones score. The app calculates and keeps track of every player's score making the score calculation aspect of Dutch Blitz trivial!
- [GPACalc](https://github.com/lwaschuk/GPACalc) - GPACalc was the predecessor to BetterGrades. As a PoC I made this command line app a term before creating BetterGrades to see if it would have actually been useful to me (and of course others).
- [Kotlin CLI Chess](https://github.com/lwaschuk/Kotlin-Command-Line-Chess) - Kotlin CLI Chess was the project I worked on to learn Kotlin. It's a fully functional command line version of chess respecting all of the typical rules of the game.
