### Some of the projects I've completed...
- [BetterGrades](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/bettergrades/id6448234941) - BetterGrades is an grade tracking app I created at the tail end of university due to the annoyance of always entering my grades on websites to see my currect standing. The app persists your grades so you always know how your doing throughout terms.
- [GPACalc](https://github.com/lwaschuk/GPACalc) - GPACalc was the predecessor to BetterGrades. As a PoC I made this command line app a term before creating BetterGrades to see if it would have actually been useful to me (and of course others).
- [Kotlin CLI Chess](https://github.com/lwaschuk/Kotlin-Command-Line-Chess) - Kotlin CLI Chess was the project I worked on to learn Kotlin when I was a beginner.
